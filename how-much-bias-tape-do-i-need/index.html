To make your own bias tape, you will need a cut of fabric that is roughly 18” x 18”, rotary cutter, a quilting ruler, bias tape makers, and an iron.

<p>If you are adding loops, like for a hanging pot holder, be sure to include that length in your total. Okay, as i mentioned above, it’s easiest to get long bias strips from 1/2 yard of fabric that is cut from 1 yard (so that you have more surface area length for each strip). Now it is time to add enough length to the right end of the bias tape to be able to sew the 45 degree angle seem. BIAS TAPE what is it, how to make it, and why you NEED it.</p>

<p>I have found that the width of the strip to cut depends greatly on the batting. For quilts, you generally want to bind with just one edge folded, which gives you the double layer of fabric at the quilt edge that wears better.
